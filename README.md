#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bertrand Masabo,
I'm a full-stack software engineer with a penchant for UI/UX design. I'm passionate :heart: about technology and building products that make people's lives better. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, NodeJS, React-Native, REST APIs, Django, Python and Figma to name a few.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a Blockchain application using As, NEAR, and React.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning GraphQL and I will build something with it very soon.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on products focusing on health, education, hospitality and finance industries especially for the African context.
