#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bertrand Masabo,
I'm a full-stack software engineer with a penchant for UI/UX design. I'm passionate :heart: about technology and building products that make people's lives better. Some technologies I enjoy working with include JavaScript, NodeJS, React-Native, REST APIs, Django, Python and Figma to name a few.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on 2 mobile applications using React-Native for the front-end and Express for the backend.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning GraphQL and I will build something with it very soon.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on products focusing on health, education, hospitality and finance industries especially for the African context.

- âš¡ Fun fact: One thing on my bucket list is Skydiving. Okay, another thing is scuba diving. Wait, there's also swimming in the cave pools in Santorini, Greece and staying at kudadoo maldives private island ...:sweat_smile: the list is quite long, let me stop day dreaming, this code will not write itself.
